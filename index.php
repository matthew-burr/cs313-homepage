          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>I love to program and have been programming since I was a kid. I started with BASIC on our Atari, and later turned to Pascal on our PC. Over
          the years, I've programmed in BASIC, Pascal, Visual Basic, C, C++, C#, Java, Perl, and several other languages.</p>
          <p>In my career, I've focused on databases and business intelligence, and I've worked with these technologies for nearly 20 years. I've worked
          at large and small companies in diverse industries. Although I've been successful, I find that I really enjoy application programming and I'm 
          building my skillset so that I can move into application development.</p>
          <p>Outside of work, my hobbies are diverse. I love to read, particularly fiction. I'm also an amateur magician and member of the Academy of 
          Magical Arts. I enjoy board and card games, as well.</p>
